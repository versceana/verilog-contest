### Target users

- the game should be enjoyable for gamers of any age, the included puzzles should require some critical thinking but be solvable in an adequate time nevertheless, the story should bring both kids and adults thoughts and ideas for light contemplation. We consider our users' primary needs to be spending their pastime with a considerable amount of intellectual stimulation and aesthetic pleasure;

- the needs of our more sophisticated players include inventive mechanics and original storyline. Level design should be thoroughly thought through and aid to the gaming process, mechanics should be diverse enough to be fascinating for experienced users, and the storyline must include logical (and probably not open) end, possibly with several endings. The conflict in the game should also be complex enough to keep the players invested.
