# Week 2

# Detailed Requirements Elaboration

## Updated/detailed user stories

- As a user, I want to chat with the AI in natural language (e.g., "Reschedule my meetings for today") so I can manage tasks conversationally.

- As a user, I want the AI to answer follow-up questions about my schedule (e.g., "What's my next task?") so I can stay informed without checking manually.

- As a user, I want to add or edit tasks by speaking (e.g., "Add a gym session at 6 PM") so I can capture ideas hands-free.

- As a user, I want the AI to transcribe my brainstorming sessions into actionable notes so I can organize ideas faster.

- As a user, I want the AI to automatically shift tasks if I'm running late so my schedule stays realistic.

- As a user, I want the AI to suggest urgent task rescheduling (e.g., "Move this deadline due to low priority") so I can focus on what matters.

- As a user, I want the AI to remind me of habits (e.g., "You usually read at 9 PM") so I can maintain routines.

- As a user, I want the AI to propose breaks based on my productivity patterns so I can avoid burnout.

- As a user, I want the AI to auto-categorize tasks into "To-Do/Doing/Done" columns so I can visualize progress.

- As a user, I want the AI to flag stalled tasks (e.g., "This hasn't moved in 3 days") so I can take action.

- As a user, I want the AI to suggest indoor tasks (e.g., "Work on emails") when bad weather is forecasted so my plans stay flexible.

- As a user, I want the AI to recommend nearby coffee shops for meetings based on my preferences (e.g., "Quiet, with WiFi").

- As a user, I want a weekly report showing my peak productivity hours so I can plan deep work accordingly.

- As a user, I want the AI to compare planned vs. actual task time so I can improve time estimates.

- As a user, I want two-factor authentication for my connected accounts so my data stays secure.

- As a user, I want a free tier with basic features (e.g., task tracking) so I can test the tool before paying.

## Project Architecture

![Architecture](https://github.com/setterwars/Capstone-project-2025/blob/main/arch.png?raw=true)

### Core Components (Dockerized Microservices)

1. Backend (Server)
   - Handles the core logic and processing of calendar data.

   - Exposes REST APIs for interaction with both the frontend and AI agent.

   - Interfaces with a database to store and retrieve calendar data.

   - Processes incoming calendar data and responds to AI-generated suggestions or user requests.

2. Database
   - Responsible for persisting calendar data.

   - Communicates with the backend to store or retrieve events, tasks, or other time-related data.

   - Runs in a Docker container, managed with Docker Compose.

3. Web Interface
   - A user-facing frontend application.

   - Connects to the backend via REST API.

   - Provides a graphical interface for users to manage calendar entries.

   - Also containerized with Docker for isolated deployment.

4. Docker Compose
   - Manages the lifecycle and orchestration of the backend and frontend containers.

   - Ensures both services are networked correctly and can communicate via internal Docker networking.

### AI Agent Integration

- The AI agent interacts with the backend via API requests.

- It can enhance the calendar functionality through:

   - DeepSeek API

   - ChatGPT API

   - Hugging Face Transformers API

- Possible tasks for the AI agent include:

   - Natural language interpretation of user input.

   - Suggesting optimal scheduling based on user behavior or preferences.

   - Summarizing tasks, rescheduling, detecting conflicts



## User flow

Based on the choosen requirements, we have developed a user flow that will underpin our project.

![User flow](https://github.com/setterwars/Capstone-project-2025/blob/main/user_flow.png?raw=true)

1. Main Page with Basic Information

   - This is the landing page where users are introduced to the application.

   - It contains general information about the service and encourages users to register.

2. Registration Page

   - After viewing the main page, users proceed to register for access to the platform.

   - Successful registration leads to the main interface.

3. Main Page

   - After registration, users enter the main page of the application.

   - This serves as the central hub for all user activity.

4. Topbar Navigation (highlighted in pink)

   - From the main page, users can navigate through the app using a topbar menu.

   - This allows quick access to all core features of the platform.

5. Core Features (Accessible via Topbar Navigation):

   - Calendar: Manage personal events and schedules.

   - Dashboard / Analytics: View user-specific data and visual analytics.

   - Chat with AI: Engage in interactive conversations with an AI assistant.

   - Recommendations: Receive personalized suggestions based on user data.

   - Geo/Weather Assistant: Access location-based services and weather forecasts.

## Prioritized Backlog

**Backlog screenshot**:

![Backlog](https://github.com/setterwars/Capstone-project-2025/blob/main/backlog.png?raw=true)

All issues are divided into iterations. In total we have 6 iterations. Also, as you can see, all issues are prioritized in the backlog. The issues have their size indicated to estimate the time needed to complete each task.

# Project-specific progress

## Frontend

This week we designed the frontend and start develop it.

**Link to the Figma design:** https://www.figma.com/design/um3jVUbRhCpPOtH0rnKo8D/EGO-AI--Copy-?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=U4B3WouucLmUfJRt-0

In this week will be implemented to 2 pages of the frontend part. Firstly it is calendar page. And In this week will be implemented skeleton of the main page.

**Google Account usage**

In this week we implement authentication using google account. In the next week we planed to implement integration with google calendar.

![Google auth 1](https://github.com/setterwars/Capstone-project-2025/blob/main/photo_2025-06-17_12-37-45.jpg?raw=true)

## ML

In week #2 we added:

- voice chat with Whisper
- chat with LLM Architecture

For chat with LLM used **deepseek-r1:1.5b**. For voice model used **whisper** and for embedding used model **mxbai-embed-large**

In the next week for LLM chat we will create pages in frontend and we will connect this page with this LLM chat

## DevOps

This week, our DevOps engineer worked on automating project deployments by setting up a custom script to seamlessly push updates to the server. 
Manually deploying code changes is time-consuming and error-prone. To improve efficiency, we needed a reliable automation script that would:
- Fetch the latest code from the repository
-  Run necessary build steps (e.g., dependency installation, compilation)
-  Securely transfer files to the production/staging server
-  Restart services if required

**Deployment Script snippet**
