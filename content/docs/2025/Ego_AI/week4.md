# Testing, CI/CD & Deployment Setup ‚Äî Week #4

---

## **Testing and QA**

We conducted basic testing to verify the functionality of API endpoints (i.e., checking whether they respond and work as expected).

 But now we have less coverage by tests. In the future we will improve it by creating more complex tests and improoving of the code quality.

### Evidence of Test Execution

## **CI/CD Setup**

As you can see from spript to keep private data like API keys or databases passwords we use github secrets.

## **Deployment**

### Staging
For staging server deployment, we use an auto-deployment script integrated into our CI/CD pipeline.  
All `.env` files are manually configured on the server by the DevOps engineer or team lead.

For running our web site we use docker files and docker compose what run all this docker files.


### Production
We deploy a new version of the product weekly to the production server.  
The current deployment is available at:

- üåê [http://egoai.duckdns.org:3000](http://egoai.duckdns.org:3000)

Also you can acsess to the API documentation using this link:

- üåê [http://egoai.duckdns.org:8000/docs](http://egoai.duckdns.org:8000/docs)

We use a server located in Germany due to regional limitations of the AI API key.  
The domain is configured using [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/).

## **Vibe Check**

The team is staying motivated and productive. Everyone is focused on their tasks, and communication has been smooth throughout the week. We faced some minor technical challenges with the MongoDB setup and CI/CD pipeline, but they were resolved quickly thanks to good collaboration. Progress feels steady, and we're gaining momentum as more features come together. There‚Äôs a clear sense of direction, and the team is aligned on our short-term goals. Overall, the vibe is positive and focused.
