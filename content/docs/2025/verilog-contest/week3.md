## Internal demo

*Notes from internal demo on 23 June 2025:*

* **Attendees**: Diana, Mikhail, Aleksei, Vladislav, Sofia
* **Feedback:**

  * Core CRUD & Auth: stable
  * Runner: functional
  * Runner: in process
  * CI/CD: staticcheck errors need fixes
  * Frontend: basic UI ready
* **Action Items:**

  1. Backend: Runner-Manager integration into API flow
  2. Frontend: implement Submit API wiring and Results page
  3. DevOps: complete Docker Hub pushes in CI/CD, initiate Kubernetes deployment

## Plan for Next Week

In Week #4, we will integrate the Submit into the frontend and develop the Results page. On the backend, our goal is to finalize Runner‑Manager integration. We will also deploy the full stack in a staging environment via docker‑compose, enhance the CI/CD pipeline check new dev changes, deploy the Kubernetes.

## Confirmation of the code's operability

We confirm that the code in the main branch:

- [✔] In working condition.
- [✔] Run via docker-compose.
