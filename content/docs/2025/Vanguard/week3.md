# Weekly commitments

## Individual contribution of each participant

##### Ramazan Nazmiev

###### 1. Overview

Introduce end-to-end integration tests covering:

- Session creation in Session Service
- Participant join via Session Service (receive JWT + WS endpoint)
- WebSocket connections to Real-Time Service using returned JWT
- Session start in Session Service ‚Üí RabbitMQ event
- Real-Time Service consumes event and broadcasts to connected clients
- Clients receive ‚Äúsession started‚Äù notification over WS

###### 2. Key Refactoring

- **Config via env vars**: both services read `MQ_URL`, `REDIS_ADDR`, `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `SESSION_SERVICE_HOST/PORT`, `REALTIME_HOST/PORT`.
- **Startup functions**: encapsulate service initialization in functions accepting `context.Context`, returning errors; avoid untestable `main()`.
- **WebSocket handler**: validate JWT correctly, thread-safe connection registry, broadcast logic on RabbitMQ events.
- **Session endpoints**: 
  - `POST /sessions`: create session, return admin JWT, session ID, WS endpoint.
  - `POST /join`: validate code, return participant JWT + WS endpoint.
- **Logging**: add concise structured logs around startup, connections, event publish/consume, broadcasts.

###### 3. Integration Test Implementation

- **Location**: `integration_tests/e2e_test.go` (with `//go:build integration`).
- **Dependencies**: use `testcontainers-go` to spin up:
  - RabbitMQ container (expose container port 5672 to random host port; load definitions).
  - Redis container (expose 6379).
- **Port mapping**: obtain actual host:port via `MappedPort` and pass via env (`MQ_URL`, `REDIS_ADDR`).
- **Service startup**:
  1. Set env vars for each service (host/port, MQ_URL, REDIS_ADDR, JWT_SECRET_KEY).
  2. Launch Real-Time Service in a goroutine; wait for WS readiness (poll `/ws?token=invalid`).
  3. Launch Session Service in a goroutine; wait for HTTP readiness (`/healthz`).
- **E2E flow**:
  1. `POST /sessions` ‚Üí admin token, session ID, WS endpoint.
  2. `POST /join` twice ‚Üí participant tokens + same WS endpoint.
  3. Dial WS for each participant with `?token=<jwt>`.
  4. Real-Time Service consumes and broadcasts; test reads from each WS connection within timeout and asserts expected JSON (e.g., `type: "session_started"`).
- **Cleanup**: close WS connections; terminate containers; cancel service contexts.

##### Ramil Aminov

* - Integrated WebSocket communication with a Go backend using the Gorilla WebSocket library.
  - Established WebSocket connections from the frontend after a successful session initialization via REST API.
  - Created a session lifecycle:
    
        1. User selects a quiz from the available list.
        2. A session is started via the POST /api/session/start endpoint.
        3. Response includes metadata such as serverWsEndpoint, userId, and userType.
  - Configured session metadata storage in sessionStorage, including quizId, userId, and session token.
  - Dynamically connected to WebSocket using the endpoint returned from the API and attaching a JWT token as a query parameter.
  - Used useRef to persist WebSocket instance across component renders, ensuring controlled message sending and connection lifecycle.
  - Implemented message handlers (onopen, onmessage, onerror, onclose) for receiving real-time updates from the server.

  ## Plan for Next Week

### 1. Authentication & Authorization (Python + Go + Frontend)

- **Implement basic JWT-based auth**  
  - Design user model and token flow: access token + refresh token.  
  - Integrate login/register and token refresh logic in Python service.  
  - Add middleware in Go services to validate tokens and extract user identity/role.  
  - Frontend: build login/register pages, store tokens securely, handle refresh automatically.  
  - Tests: integration checks for login/logout flows.

---

### 2. Go Backend Updates

- **Integrate auth into existing services**  
  
  - Update session and real-time services to require valid tokens and respect user roles.  
  - Adjust logic so user identity comes from the token instead of anonymous IDs.  
  - Ensure error handling when auth fails (e.g., reject unauthorized actions).

- **Redis caching and state sync in Real-Time service**  
  
  - Configure Redis client: store current session state (active question, timer, partial results).  
  - On service start or client reconnect, load state from Redis so sessions continue smoothly.  
  - Clean up cached state when a session ends.

- **Leaderboard functionality (basic)**  
  
  - Add or refine a component/service to accumulate and cache scores in Redis (e.g., sorted sets).  
  - Ensure Real-Time service updates and uses this data to broadcast ranking updates to clients.  
  - simple integration test with Redis.

---

### 3. Frontend Enhancements

- **WebSocket communication robustness**  
  
  - Enhance WS client logic: detect and recover from connection errors, attempt reconnect with backoff.  
  - Handle auth failures on WS (e.g., token expiry), redirecting users to login or re-join flows.  
  - Expose connection status in UI (e.g., ‚ÄúReconnecting‚Ä¶‚Äù).

- **Auth pages and integration**  
  
  - Build login and registration interfaces; integrate with backend auth flows.  
  - After login, propagate user identity into session creation/join flows.  
  - Handle token storage (e.g., secure cookies or appropriate storage) and include tokens in API/WS calls.

- **Quiz management UI tied to auth**  
  
  - Update quiz creation/editing pages to require a logged-in user.  
  - Connect UI actions to the Python quiz service under authenticated context.  
  - Show errors or permissions feedback if user is not authorized.

---

### 4. Deployment

- **Prepare deployment for entire web app**  
  
  - Dockerize or package all components: Python service, Go services, frontend.  
  - Create or update deployment scripts/CI pipeline to build images and deploy to target server or environment.  
  - Configure environment variables and secrets (e.g., JWT secret, Redis/RabbitMQ addresses) securely.  
  - Ensure HTTPS (TLS) is set up (e.g., via reverse proxy).

- **Infrastructure readiness**  
  
  - Verify Redis and RabbitMQ are available in target environment and services can connect.  
  - Add health checks and minimal monitoring/logging to confirm services are healthy after deploy.
