*if you want to get access to it, log in to Jira with VPN and Innopolis University account*

We have three basic columns in our  board: **‚ÄúTo Do‚Äù**, **‚ÄúIn Progress‚Äù**, and **‚ÄúDone‚Äù**. Additionally, we‚Äôve added a **‚ÄúTrashed‚Äù** column to store tasks that are no longer relevant.

# Reflection after meeting with TA

---

- We need to schedule a meeting with Alexey Potyomkin to discuss potential collaboration since he is planning to do almost the same service for our university
- We need to research Microsoft Entra capabilities to make login secure

# Reflection after meeting with Alexey Potyomkin

---

### **1.Strategic planning for long-term growth**

- A brainstorming table should be created to track and organize future improvement ideas for the platform. This will support strategic planning beyond the MVP phase.
- The focus in the short term should remain on the core university use case, ensuring we deliver functional value to students and faculty first.
- Once the academic version is validated, the platform can be extended for commercial and external use cases.

### **2. Customer discovery (CustDev) & Hypothesis testing**

- We will initiate a CustDev process to validate assumptions and gather structured feedback from real users (students, teachers).
- Based on collected insights, we‚Äôll formulate and prioritize hypotheses for improvement and potential product extensions.


### **3.Stakeholder alignment**

Schedule conversations with the following stakeholders to align the platform with broader institutional goals:

- **Marko Pezer** ‚Äì regarding team distribution in SWP (Software Project) coordination.
- **Mansur Khazeev** ‚Äì to explore potential involvement in industrial projects and corporate collaboration scenarios.


### **4.Integration with digital profile ecosystem**

- A strategic suggestion was made to explore integration of TeamSync into the Innopolis Digital Profile system, enabling richer personalization, centralized data use, and long-term scalability.
- Next step: determine the technical requirements and institutional process for this integration.

## Design

---

During last week Sign-Up process (adding Roles, Skills, Project position, and Personal information) and  Homepage (with projects) were designed. Also, User Flow was updated and divided by two parts: ‚ÄúFor Students‚Äù and ‚ÄúFor Teachers‚Äù. We will implement for MVP only ‚ÄúFor Students‚Äù.

## Frontend

---

This week, the basic frontend structure was made [TS-28], two skeleton pages were made (splash and home) [TS-29] and a simple route was set up between them. There weren‚Äôt many significant issues with the front end of the project, the only issue was dynamic page layouts. This issue will be fixed by the end of the week, after the design is updated with new mobile layouts, dropdown menus and hover button styles. Next week, the focus will be on SSO functionality via Microsoft Entra and integration with the backend.

## Backend

---

During the last week we developed initial database scheme [TS-36] and wrote liquibase migrations [TS-39]. Also defined the backend architecture [TS-45] and created APIs for the services (RestAPI and gRPC): [TS-50], [TS-51], [TS-56], [TS-59]. Studied the SSO that we are using (Microsoft Entra ID) and described how to work with it at our [team‚Äôs notion site](https://www.notion.so/SSO-210c1c5fc56980f294fdf65cb817ed65?pvs=21). And the last one - started the development of auth service [TS-59].

During the week we faced some problems, related to overall architecture and contracts, but we spoke about it together and decided to do it how it done now. The biggest problem was about filtering recommendation that were calculated by ML services. It was not clear what services should do it and how (backend or ML services). We decided to leave that feature and return to it later, but anyways, during the discussion , there were some important notes and takes related to the problem and we will definitely return to them later!

You can check out services‚Äô api‚Äôs at the back/*some service* directory in our github repository. Some of them are RestAPI conrtacts (api.yaml), written in openApi format and can be viewed at online swagger editor, others are *.proto gRPC contracts

## ML

---

During the last week, we discussed baseline models and project architecture [TS-34]. We collected basic datasets for roles and tools [TS-35]. We wanted to collect a dataset of projects from the Capstone project organization, but the task turned out to be too difficult because it is hard to understand who knows what, who does what, and who is who from the participant table. It is easier to synthesize the data ourselves, but we took project names and descriptions from the Capstone project table and added people to them with roles and skills [TS-56].
