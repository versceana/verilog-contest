# Detailed Requirements Elaboration 
This week, the primary objective is to implement the core functionality for both backend and frontend of the application. 

### Backend Tasks:
* Develop full CRUD functionality for the following entities: bookings, books, libraries, and users.

* Implement all necessary API endpoints for the above CRUD operations.

* Set up user authorization and registration.

* Establish a working database, and encapsulate it using Docker containers for consistent deployment.

* Integrate CI/CD pipelines to enable automated deployment on each push to the main branch.

* Configure a temporary domain to test deployed versions of the application.

### Frontend Tasks:
* Begin layout of the Main Page, initially without styling.

* Start building the Book Page and the Account Page, including navigation between them.

* Implement user authorization and registration pages with completed styling and functionality.

### Design
#### User Flow Diagrams
We've developed 4 comprehensive user flow diagrams to visualize our system's navigation:

 **Auth Selection Flow**  
   Demonstrates the initial account type selection between:
   - Administrator
   - Library Manager
   - User (Reader)
