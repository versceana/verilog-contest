- An ability to walkthrough generated course.
- An ability to track progress through marking subtopics as done/undone.

### Functional user journeys

**1. Course Creation Journey**

User Goal: Generate and save a personalized course based on their inputs.
  - User opens the website and get on the home page.
  - User clicks on "Create New Course".    
  - User provides inputs (e.g., topic, difficulty level, duration).    
  - Frontend validation ensures required fields are filled correctly (error handling).
  - User submits the form -> the system processes inputs and generates a structured course.    
  - User reviews the generated course and clicks "Save."    
  - The course is stored in their dashboard.<br><br>

**2. Course Progress Tracking Journey**
   
User Goal: Track learning progress.
 - User navigates to their dashboard and selects a saved course.
 - Course displays lessons in a sidebar and subtopics in lesson page.  
 - User clicks a checkbox next to a subtopic to toggle completion status.  
 - Backend updates progress and last activity time.<br><br>

**3. Course Deletion Journey**

User Goal: Remove an unwanted/completed course.
 - User views their list of saved courses.
 - User clicks a "Delete" button on the bottom of the course page.  
 - Frontend confirms the action.  
 - Backend processes the DELETE request -> course is removed from the dashboard.
