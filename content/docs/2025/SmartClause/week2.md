## Project specific progress

### User flow diagram
![User flow diagram](https://github.com/IU-Capstone-Project-2025/SmartClause/blob/main/course-metadata/week2-images/userflow.png)

### Design
The platform provides a complete web interface with three main screens:
1. **Upload Screen**: Drag-and-drop interface for document upload.
2. **Processing Screen**: Real-time processing status with progress indicators.
3. **Results Screen**: Comprehensive analysis results with risks and recommendations.

### Frontend
- **Technology**: Vue.js 3 with modern UI components and routing.
- **User Interface**: A full web application with a complete UI workflow for document analysis, featuring:
    - A smart upload interface with drag-and-drop and progress tracking.
    - A real-time processing screen with status updates.
    - A comprehensive results screen with detailed analysis.
- **Architecture**: The frontend is a Vue.js Single Page Application (SPA) running on port 8080.
