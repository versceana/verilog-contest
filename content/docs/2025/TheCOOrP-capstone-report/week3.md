# Week 3

## Implemented MVP features

- **Energy:**
  - Main goal of the game.
  - Anomalies generate energy on interaction with Agents.
- **Anomaly interactions:**
  - Agents interact with Anomalies to generate Energy.
- **COOPerative Multiplayer:**
  - Multiple players are able to play together via local multiplayer.
- **Map:**
  - All planned facility modules are implemented.
  - Agents can be selected and sent to any location.
  - Agents can navigate the complex with ease.
- **Anomaly research menu:**
  - In this menu, you can unlock info about anomalies and read their description.
  - It is planned to give player an ability to unlock and manufacture the gear for the employees by spending the resources.

### User Journey

#### Main Loop:

- **Energy Collection Goal:** Each day has a quota of (energy) you must produce by working on Anomalies.
- **Order Agents to Work:** Agents perform tasks on Abnormalities (e.g., Instinct, Insight, Attachment, Repression), each with different risks and rewards.
- Success yields energy.
- Failure may trigger the Abnormalityâ€™s negative effects.
- When you collect enough energy for the quota you will be able to move onto the next day.

## Internal demo

After conducting the internal demo, we identified a few major bugs:

- Shop Research Currency counter does not update after purchase.
- Work is not synced between clients.
- You can move working Agent, which breaks the game state.
- You can move Agent into an occupied chamber, which resets current working progress.
- Our stakeholder highlighted the lack of polishing.
