## Detailed requirements elaboration

### Prioritized backlog
Kanban board:
https://github.com/orgs/IU-Capstone-Project-2025/projects/3/views/1
### Project specific progress
**Frontend**
- Organized the frontend structure for scalability.
- Implemented basic routing for navigation.
- Developed partially registration page.

**Backend**
- Organized the backend structure for scalability.
- Dockerized the project for deployment.
- Established database schema and connected the profile microservice to PostgreSQL.
- Defined the initial API contract for future integrations.
- Implemented authorization via Telegram.

**Design**
- Created Figma designs for registration and user feeds pages.
- Completed registration userflow schemas.

### Expanded user stories

- As a new user, I want to set up a profile with my preferred sports, location, and availability, so the app can suggest compatible activity partners.
    - As a new user, I want to sign up via Telegram, so that I can register quickly without creating a password.
    - As a new user, I want to select multiple sports from a list, so that partners are suggested based on my activity interests.
    - As a new user, I want to specify my favorite places to do sports, so that partners are suggested based on my preferred sport locations.
    - As a new user, I want to mark my weekly availability, so that partners are suggested based on my availability.
    
- As a registered user, I want to browse and filter potential matches by sport, location, and availability, so I can find partners suited to my preferences.

- As a registered user, I want to view a match’s profile and open a Telegram chat with him/her, so we can communicate privately.
    - As a registered user, I want to view a match's complete sports profile, so that I know if we share enough interests.
    - As a registered user, I want to initiate a Telegram chat directly from a profile, so that we can coordinate without sharing phone numbers.

**Key user stories with acceptance criteria:**

- As a new user, I want to sign up via Telegram, so that I can register quickly without creating a password.
    - AC: After Telegram OAuth, the user is automatically registered and redirected to the profile setup.
- As a registered user, I want to initiate a Telegram chat directly from a profile, so that we can coordinate without sharing phone numbers.
    - AC: Clicking "Message" opens Telegram directly to a chat with the match’s username. 
- As a registered user, I want to browse and filter potential matches by sport, location, and availability, so I can find partners suited to my preferences.
    - AC:  Potential matches sorted by compatibility score, from highest to lowest.
        
## Weekly commitments

### TA's last week feedback summary 
- Although the project is dockerized, for some reason it only runs on Linux -> we need to ensure cross-platform compatibility (Windows/macOS support).
- It is recommended to use Telegram-based authentication (user registration and authorization via Telegram).
- For better user experience, the user feed should be ranked from higher to lower match relevance.
