# **Week #3**

## Implemented MVP features

The following MVP features have been implemented to date:

### Data Engineering & ML:

* Collected the initial POI dataset (approximately 50,000 items).
* Completed full data cleaning and preliminary processing.
* Implemented a pipeline for enriching POI textual descriptions using the LLM model (Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct).
* Currently, over 35,000 items have been successfully processed and enriched (70% of the total dataset).

### Backend:

* Implemented service endpoints for user registration and authorization (JWT auth).
* Remaining key endpoints for search functionality are currently represented by placeholders.

### Frontend:

* The interface is fully prepared (React/Next.js + Tailwind UI).
* Frontend is ready for integration with the operational API.


## Demonstration of the working MVP

### Data Enrichment Examples:

| Original Description        | Enriched Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## ML

**Link to the training code**: *will be provided later after completing enrichment of the entire dataset.*

The **Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct** model was used to enrich POI descriptions, adding atmospheric details and recommendations while maintaining factual accuracy. Generation parameters:

* Max new tokens: 160
* Batch size: 8
* Device: CUDA (A100 GPU)

**Links to the initial model artifacts**: [Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct)

## Internal demo

* Demonstrated examples of data enrichment.
* Showed interface awaiting API integration.
* Discussed next steps and priorities for the upcoming week (completion of data processing and initiation of API integration).

# Weekly commitments

## Plan for Next Week

* Complete dataset enrichment.
* Implement and test key search endpoints on the backend.
* Integrate backend API with frontend.

## Confirmation of the code's operability

We confirm that the code in the main branch:

* [ ] Is in working condition.
* [ ] Runs via docker-compose (or another alternative described in the `README.md`).
