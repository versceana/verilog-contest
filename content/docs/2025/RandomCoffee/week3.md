# **Week #3**

## Implemented MVP features

1. User registration  
User is able to enter his name, surname, bio, and able to choose relevant tags for him.  

2. Matchmaking  
There is an endpoint to start the mathmaking. Backend sends every user info to the ML services. There matchmaking is created using Greedy Algorithm. Then every user can see his match partner on the main page of the application.  


## Demonstration of the working MVP

### Current Status: Individual Components Functional, Integration Pending

Due to critical connectivity issues identified during the internal demo, we are currently unable to demonstrate the complete end-to-end MVP functionality. However, we can provide evidence of individual components working correctly in isolation.

### What We Can Demonstrate

#### **1. Backend Services (Individual Testing)**
- **Profile Service**: Successfully handles user registration and profile management
- **ML Service**: Matchmaking algorithms process test data correctly
- **API Gateway**: Routes requests properly when tested individually
- **Database**: PostgreSQL operations working as expected

#### **2. Frontend Components (Standalone)**
- **Telegram Mini App Interface**: Responsive design and user interaction working
- **User Registration Form**: Form validation and data handling functional
- **Profile Display**: UI components render correctly with mock data

#### **3. ML Algorithms (Independent Testing)**
- **Matchmaking Results**: Successfully generated 7 optimal pairs from 15 test users
- **Algorithm Performance**: Greedy algorithm executed in under 1 second
- **Test Data Processing**: Handles diverse user profiles correctly

### What We Cannot Demonstrate Currently

#### **ðŸš¨ Integration Issues Preventing End-to-End Demo**
- **Frontend-Backend Communication**: CORS policy blocking requests
- **Service-to-Service Communication**: Individual services cannot communicate
- **Complete User Flow**: Registration â†’ Matchmaking â†’ Display workflow broken
- **Real-time Updates**: Cannot show live data flow between components

### Evidence of Progress

#### **Code Repository Status**
- âœ… All services implemented and functional in isolation
- âœ… Clean code architecture with proper separation of concerns
- âœ… Comprehensive ML algorithms with multiple approaches
- âœ… Docker containerization working for individual services

#### **Test Results Available**
- **ML Algorithm Testing**: Results available in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xRORisdIRQ13OepizWz4gcRm3a1ploQD?usp=sharing)
- **Individual Service Testing**: All backend services respond correctly to direct API calls
- **Frontend Component Testing**: UI components work with mock data

### Alternative Demonstration Approach

While we cannot show the complete integrated system, on meeting with TA we can demonstrate:
- **Individual service functionality** through direct API testing
- **ML algorithm performance** with test data results
- **Frontend UI components** with mock data
- **Architecture and code quality** through repository review

This approach would showcase the technical implementation quality while being transparent about the current integration challenges.

## ML

### Matchmaking Model Overview

#### 1. Data Used

##### User Data
- Each user is represented as a dictionary with:
  - `user_id`: Unique identifier
  - `bio`: A short text about the user (e.g., profession, interests)
  - `tags`: A list of tags/interests (e.g., "AI", "music", "sports")

##### History Data
- A list of previous pairings:
  - `user_id1`, `user_id2`: The two users who were matched
  - `timestamp`: When the match occurred

---

#### 2. Preprocessing

- **Text Preprocessing:**  
  - Lowercasing, removing punctuation, numbers, and extra spaces.
  - Tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming (using NLTK).
- **Bio Embeddings:**  
  - User bios are embedded using a pre-trained SentenceTransformer model (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).
- **Tag Embeddings/Similarity:**  
  - Tags are compared using either Jaccard distance (set overlap) or semantic similarity (using the same embedding model).

---

#### 3. Model Approaches

Several matchmaking algorithms are implemented:

##### A. Genetic Algorithm Matcher
- Population-based optimization to find the best set of user pairs.
- Fitness function combines:
  - Bio similarity (cosine similarity of embeddings)
  - Tag similarity (Jaccard or semantic)
  - Penalty for recent pairings (to avoid repeating matches)
- **Parameters:**
  - `coef_a`, `coef_b`: Weights for bio and tag similarity
  - `penalty_multiplier`: How much to penalize recent matches
  - `pop_size`: Number of solutions per generation
  - `generations`: Number of generations to evolve
  - `mutation_rate`: Probability of mutation in each generation

##### B. Greedy Matcher
- Pairs users by always choosing the highest-scoring available pair.
- Uses the same scoring as above.

##### C. Clustering + Greedy
- Users are clustered (KMeans) based on their bio embeddings.
- Greedy matching is performed within clusters to ensure similar users are paired.

##### D. Clustering + Simulated Annealing
- Users are clustered as above.
- Simulated annealing is used to optimize pairings, allowing for some randomness to escape local optima.

---

#### 4. Parameters Used for Decision-Making

- **Bio Similarity Weight (`coef_a`)**: How much the similarity of user bios matters.
- **Tag Similarity Weight (`coef_b`)**: How much the overlap or semantic similarity of tags matters.
- **Penalty Multiplier**: Reduces the score for users who have been paired recently.
- **Tag Distance Function**: Choice between Jaccard (set overlap) or semantic (embedding-based) similarity.
- **Embedding Model**: Pre-trained model used for text and tag embeddings (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).
- **Algorithm-Specific Parameters**:
  - For genetic: population size, number of generations, mutation rate.
  - For clustering: number of clusters.
  - For annealing: initial temperature, cooling rate, number of iterations.

---

#### 5. Training Process

- No supervised training is performed; instead, the model uses pre-trained embeddings and optimization algorithms (genetic, greedy, clustering, annealing) to find the best pairings based on the current user data and history.
- The "training" is in the sense of optimizing pairings for each run, not in fitting a model to labeled data.
